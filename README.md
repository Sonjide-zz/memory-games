Memory Game, also known as the Concentration card game or Matching Game.

In this repo, I will be putting extra focus on setting Attributes in JavaScript.

## What inbuilt functions are we going to focus on?

- for loops
- addEventListener
- setAttribute
- getAttribute
- data-name
- document.querySelector
- createElement

## Rules of Memory Game

- You will start by flipping over one card
- If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score
- These cards then disspear
- If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of ths and the cards flip back
- The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
